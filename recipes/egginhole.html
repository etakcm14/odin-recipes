    <h3>This is a simple breakfast that hits the spot.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1thick slice of bread - sourdough is a good choice</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>hot sauce - optional</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a large glass to cut a hole in the center of the bread.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a cast iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>When butter is melted, add the slice and circle of bread to the pan.</li>
            <li>Allow bread to toast for a minute, then crack the egg into the hole. It's ok if it overflows onto the bread a little bit.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper over egg and cook until it begins to set.</li>
            <li>Flip the toast and egg and cook to desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Serve egg in a hole on a plate with the circle of bread and top with hot sauce if desired.</li>
        </ol>

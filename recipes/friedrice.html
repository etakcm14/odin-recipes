    <h3>Fried rice is quick to put together and delicious. For best results use day old rice.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 head broccoli, cut into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
            <li>2 scallions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, scrambled</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted seasame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sauce by whisking together soy sauce, garlic, sugar, and a pinch of salt. </li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in cast iron or wok over medium high heat. When pan is hot add onion and carrots and cook undisturbed until charred, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for a few more minutes. Then transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 with the broccoli and scallions.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tbsp of oil and add eggs. Eggs will cook quickly so keep stiring and be ready to add the rice as soon as curds begin to form.</li>
            <li>Add rice and sauce to the pan. Mix everything together then press it into the pan and cook undisturbed for about 5 minutes or until rice is crisped.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from heat and add veggies back into rice and eggs. Add seasame oil and rice vinegar and mix well. </li>
        </ol>
